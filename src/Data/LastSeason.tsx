  `I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to exist.`,
  `We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice.`,
  `I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.`,
  `I think I could have stopped it because I have very tough illegal immigration policies, and people aren't coming into this country unless they're vetted and vetted properly.`,
  `It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!`,
  `No matter what you do - guns, no guns - it doesn't matter. You have people that are mentally ill. And they're gonna come through the cracks. And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible.`,
  `Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories any more. We used to have victories but [now] we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China, in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.`,

  `I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man - he made a good decision.`,
  `I look very much forward to showing my financials, because they are huge.`,
  `Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest - and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.`,
  `Certain guys tell me they want women of substance, not beautiful models. It just means they can't get beautiful models.`,
