  `When life gets hard, try to remember: the life you complain about is only a dream to some people.`,
  `Home is a notion that only nations of the homeless fully appreciate and only the uprooted comprehend.`,
  `My life was a wandering; I never had a homeland. It was a matter of being constantly tossed about, without rest; nowhere, and never did I find a home.`,
  `A castaway in the sea was going down for the third time when he caught sight of a passing ship. Gathering his last strength, he waved frantically and called for help. Someone on board peered at him scornfully and shouted back, “Get a boat!`,
  `It takes a society to combat homelessness, and a strong nation to fight poverty.`,
  `Nowhere in the bible did it say, “Only show compassion and empathy to those you can trust.” If we did that, we would be burying homeless people every day.`,
  `Let your love be the kindness to make a homeless person believe that a soul needs something more than just four walls and a ceiling.`,
  `There are millions of homeless people in the world because humanity does not have a proper conscience!`,
  `Home was never a dream for homeless people as they used to have their homes. Living in a home was their reality. Now we need to help them to find the lost reality – again.`,

  `The worst poverty isn’t about not having enough money to survive. Real poverty is when there is no one in the world who loves you. When there is no other human to make you feel like you matter. As if you aren’t worth the air you breathe. Poverty of love is the worst thing you can be deprived of.`,
