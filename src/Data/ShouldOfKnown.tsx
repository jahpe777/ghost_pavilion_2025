  `Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words. Trust movement.`,
  `Don't try to rush progress. Remember -- a step forward, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction. Keep believing.`,
  `All creative activity begins with movement.`,
  `Consciousness is only possible through change; change is only possible through movement.`,
  `In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.`,
  `We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.`,
  `Nothing is more revealing than movement.`,
  `Life is a balance between rest and movement.`,
  `When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy.`,
  `To me, if life boils down to one thing, it's movement. To live is to keep moving.`,
  `Change means movement. Movement means frictions`,
  `We see in order to move; we move in order to see.`,
  `All that is important is this one moment in movement. Make the moment important, vital, and worth living. Do not let it slip away unnoticed and unused.`,
  `There can be no transforming of darkness into light and of apathy into movement without emotion.`,
  `It's great to want to be part of something, but it's a different thing completely to believe wholly in some type of movement, and to give everything for that something.`,
  `All things change, nothing is extinguished. There is nothing in the whole world which is permanent. Everything flows onward; all things are brought into being with a changing nature; the ages themselves glide by in constant movement.`,
  `When you step back and watch people, you realize that we use every single body part. Movement, dance - I find it genius because it's ultimate expression, really.`,
  `The least movement is of importance to all nature. The entire ocean is affected by a pebble.`,
  `I always feel the movement is a sort of mosaic. Each of us puts in one little stone, and then you get a great mosaic at the end.`,
  `For any movement to gain momentum, it must start with a small action.`,
